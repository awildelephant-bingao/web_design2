        <h2>Elephant Rescue</h2>

        <div class="p1">
            <p>Female elephants spend their entire lives in tight-knit matrilineal family groups, 
                some of which are made up of more than ten members, including three mothers and 
                their dependent offspring, and are led by the matriarch which is often the eldest
                 female.[91] She remains leader of the group until death[86] or if she no longer 
                 has the energy for the role;[92] a study on zoo elephants showed that when the 
                 matriarch died, the levels of faecal corticosterone ('stress hormone') dramatically
                  increased in the surviving elephants.[93] When her tenure is over, the matriarch's 
                  eldest daughter takes her place; this occurs even if her sister is present.[86] One 
                  study found that younger matriarchs are more likely than older ones to under-react 
                  to severe danger.[94] Family groups may split after becoming too large for the available 
                  resources.[95]

                The social circle of the female elephant does not necessarily end with the small family 
                unit. In the case of elephants in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, a female's life involves
                 interaction with other families, clans, and subpopulations. Families may associate and bond 
                 with each other, forming what are known as bond groups which typically made of two family 
                 groups. During the dry season, elephant families may cluster together and form another 
                 level of social organisation known as the clan. Groups within these clans do not form strong 
                 bonds, but they defend their dry-season ranges against other clans. There are typically
                  nine groups in a clan. The Amboseli elephant population is further divided into the "central" and "peripheral" subpopulations.[91]
                
                Some elephant populations in India and Sri Lanka have similar basic social organisations.
                 There appear to be cohesive family units and loose aggregations. They have been observed 
                 to have "nursing units" and "juvenile-care units". In southern India, elephant populations 
                 may contain family groups, bond groups and possibly clans. Family groups tend to be small, 
                 consisting of one or two adult females and their offspring. A group containing more than 
                 two adult females plus offspring is known as a "joint family". Malay elephant populations 
                 have even smaller family units, and do not have any social organisation higher than a family
                  or bond group.[91] Groups of African forest elephants typically consist of one adult female
                   with one to three offspring. These groups appear to interact with each other, especially at
                    forest clearings.[91]
                
                The social life of the adult male is very different. As he matures, a male spends more time 
                at the edge of his group and associates with outside males or even other families. At Amboseli,
                g males spend over 80% of their time away from their families when they are 14â€“15. When males
                 permanently leave, they either live alone or with other males. The former is typical of bulls 
                 in dense forests. Asian males are usually solitary, but occasionally form groups of two or more 
                 individuals; the largest consisted of seven bulls. Larger bull groups consisting of over 10
                  members occur only among African bush elephants, the largest of which numbered up to 144 
                  individuals.[96]
                
                Male elephants can be quite sociable when not competing for dominance or mates, and will form 
                long-term relationships.[97] A dominance hierarchy exists among males, whether they range socially 
                or solitarily. Dominance depends on the age, size and sexual condition,[96] and when in groups, 
                males follow the lead of the dominant bull. Young bulls may seek out the company and leadership of
                 older, more experienced males,[97] whose presence appears to control their aggression and prevent 
                 them from exhibiting "deviant" behaviour.[98] Adult males and females come together for reproduction.
                  Bulls associate with family groups if an oestrous cow is present.[96]
